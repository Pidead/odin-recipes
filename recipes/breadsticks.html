    <h3>Description</h3>

    These Buffalo chicken breadsticks are a new—and super easy—way to serve up a party favorite. Creamy, spicy Buffalo
    <p>chicken dip is baked on top of easy crescent roll dough bread. And the ranch dressing dunk tames the heat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can crescent roll dough</li>
        <li>4 pieces fried chicken strips, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Buffalo sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar Jack cheese blend</li>
        <li>2 green onions, finely chopped, or as needed for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            <p>Brush oil evenly along bottom  and sides of a bread loaf pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove crescent dough from the can and slice the whole roll of dough in half
             <p>lengthwise. Place dough, cut sides down, into prepared pan, pressing it down</p>
             <p>slightly. Top dough evenly with chicken and drizzle evenly with Buffalo sauce.</p>
             <p>Sprinkle cheese evenly over the top. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown around the edges,
            <p>15 to 18 minutes. Carefully remove loaf from the pan onto a cutting board </p>
            <p>and slice across the loaf into 8 pieces. Sprinkle with green onions, and serve</p>
            <p>with ranch dressing.</p>

        </li>
    </ol>
